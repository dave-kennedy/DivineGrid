### Thanks

Thanks to [Harry Roberts](http://www.csswizardry.com/), creator of inuit.css, from which the Divine Grid draws heavy inspiration. Also, many thanks to [Nicole Sullivan](http://www.stubbornella.org/) for pointing out the secret benefit of the overflow property and making the media object a common practice. Finally, thanks to [Ethan Marcotte](http://www.unstoppablerobotninja.com/) for teaching me everything I know about fluid grids and responsive design, and to [Chuck Greene](http://www.ideabook.com/tutorials/page_layout/the_grid_an_invisible_framewor.html) for teaching me about grids in general.
